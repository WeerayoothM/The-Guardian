It would be a “colossal exercise”, he said. The government was providing GPs with £150m to fund the programme.</p> <p>Hancock also said this would be a seven-days-a-week programme, involving the vaccine being distributed through care homes, GPs and pharmacists as well as “go-to” vaccination centres set up in venues such as sports halls. Vaccination would go on during the day and “into the evenings”, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will be working across the NHS with the support of the armed forces seven days a week, over weekends, over bank holidays, to get this rolled out into people’s arms as quickly as possible.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Hancock also expressed a note of caution. Yesterday, in a notable exchange on the BBC’s World at One,<strong> Sir John Bel</strong><strong>l</strong>, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, told the presenter, Sarah Montague, that the vaccine news meant he was now confident life should be returning to normal by spring.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCRadio4/status/1325832814634340353\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;Yes, yes, yes&quot; said the Professor.<br><br>World at One presenter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sarah_Montague?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Sarah_Montague</a> reacts to the positive early results of one of the big coronavirus vaccine trials. <a href=\"https://t.co/Gw56tkLTUL\">pic.twitter.com/Gw56tkLTUL</a></p>&mdash; BBC Radio 4 (@BBCRadio4) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCRadio4/status/1325832814634340353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 9, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Hancock was more equivocal. Asked if he agreed with Bell, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We want to get life back to normal as quickly as possible. I am not going to put a date on it because there are so many steps we need to go through.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> Boris Johnson chairs cabinet.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> The ONS publishes it weekly death figures for England and Wales.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> Fiona Hill, Theresa May’s former co-chief of staff, is among various former No 10 aides giving evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee on the role of the PM’s office.</p> <p><em>10am:</em> Amanda Spielman, head of Ofsted, gives evidence to the Commons education committee.</p> <p><em>10.30am: </em>Dido Harding, head of NHS Test and Trace, gives evidence to the Commons health and science committees, who are holding a joint ‘coronavirus - lessons learnt’ inquiry.
